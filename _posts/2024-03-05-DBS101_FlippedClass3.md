### Topic : null values in SQL and set operations in SQL.

Set Operation
Key Concept: SQL Set operations like Union, Union All, Intersect, and Minus are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries in SQL. Each and every operation have different function like union for combining all results and eliminating duplicates, union all for combining all results without eliminating duplicates, intersect for finding common rows and lastly minus for displaying rows present in the first query but not in the second.

Takeaway: Understanding the rules and differences between these operators allows database developers and analysts to efficiently manipulate and analyze data from multiple tables. By using these operations effectively, users can merge datasets, identify commons or differences, and perform various data manipulation tasks within SQL queries.

Null Values
Key Concept: In SQL, NULL values represent missing or unknown data in a field of a table. They are distinct from zero values or fields with spaces. To check or test for NULL values, we are required to use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators rather than comparison operators like = or <.

Takeaway: Understanding how to handle NULL values is crucial in database management. Using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL helps operators to ensures accurate querying and filtering of data which enables developers and database administrators to manipulate data effectively while maintaining data integrity. Additionally, practicing with exercises helps reinforce understanding and proficiency in working with NULL values within SQL databases.
