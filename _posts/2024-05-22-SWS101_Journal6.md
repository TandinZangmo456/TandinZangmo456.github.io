### Topic: Learning x86-64 Assembly

**What is Assembly Language**

Assembly language is a low-level programming language for microprocessors and other programmable devices. It has the advantage of producing human-readable machine code directly, but it is not a common way to write applications for anything larger than small systems (IoT). Each of the assembly instructions corresponds to an operation that can be carried out by the CPU i.e. arithmetic or data movement, control flow etc.

**Instructions**

A single operation for the cpu is one instruction in assembly. An x86-64 instruction can be as simple as copying data between registers (mov) or quite complex, removing two integers (mul). Any instruction takes in operation that may be immediate values or registers and memory addresses.

**Getting the Tools**
There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.

Assembler: The brain of the computer, CPU, reads machine code—an efficient but hard to understand set of instructions. Assembly language helps make it easier for people to read. An assembler changes the symbolic code to machine code. We will use Flat Assembler (FASM), which is small, easy to use, has strong macros, and an editor.

Debugger: Debuggers help check how a program works, like its parts, memory, and signals. Some standalone debuggers, like WinDbg, are better for special tasks than built-in ones like in Visual Studio. WinDbg is a strong debugger with a new look. It is on the Windows Store or in the Windows 10 SDK.

Using FASM and WinDbg makes it easier to write, put together, and test our x86-64 programs.

**Thinking in Assembly**

A high-up look
Computers just do a few set things. When people talk about "instructions", they mean the things a computer can do. Most are simple and deal with moving data around or doing basic math. There’s a lot more to it, like multiple parts working together, but this is a good start.

To work well with how computers actually work, it helps to understand how high-level ideas connect to these basic instructions.

**Registers**

A register is a small sized storage location that within the CPU used to store temporary information. Arithmetic,logical operations and execution flow control · In x86-64, there are 16 general-purpose registers : rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi, and 8 more (r8 up to and including r15). The first eight were inherited from the AMD/Intel predecessors in the 32-bit versions of the architecture: eax/ebx/ecx/etc. The registers can be accessed also in a different size (e.g., eax is the lower 32 bits of rax) Special registers include: rip (instruction pointer) and rflags (flags register).

**Memory and Addresses**
Computer memory can be thought of as a very large array of discrete, byte-sized cells, each with its own unique memory address starting at zero. The 16-bit wide registers included in earlier x86 processors allowed for direct memory addressment up to 64KB. However, the hardware has the ability to use 20-bit addresses, which makes it easier to access 1MB of memory. This was accomplished by using segment registers that included those base addresses in addition to instructions that used a 16-bit offset to construct the 20-bit linear addresses. Multiple segment registers for the code, data, and stack were included in that segmented memory paradigm, albeit there may have been some overlap.

Current x86-64 architectures, for example, pay little heed to such challenges. While kernel programmers perhaps naturally operate under a segmented memory model in which different areas of memory are separated on the hardware level, programmers operating in the user space view the memory in a linear fashion, starting from address zero. However, the operating system and the central processor keep this up through the use of virtual memory methods and techniques. Since it is often required to map several processes at once to make the computing process faster, there is a virtual address space for each process that works on the current input, and all addresses are translated into physical memory at the moment of time.

In the classic debate of Von Neumann and Harvard architecture, the former advocated for implementing data along with programming instructions and the latter favoured the storing of data and programs separately.

All these our programs and data are stored in a single memory as it is in most general-purpose computers using von Neumann’s architecture. There are still different systems, such as Harvard architecture used In AVR microcontrollers, where instructions and data are stored in different memory locations.

**Writing Our First Program**

First, to start working with FASM one needs to configure his environment by starting the FASM editor, then creating the new file where one would write own assembly code. Begin with a program that can load and terminate and then just put the learning skills on it. For instance the following code tends to make the syntax stating that the output bundle should be of PE format targeting Windows 64 splashed GUI, and this marks the entry point where the program starts with a label called start, creates a section for the program code, inserts a breakpoint instruction, Int 3; and then include a return instruction RET ; to terminate the program.

In this way, you will be able to debug your program in WinDbg. First, launch WinDBG and load your DEBUGGEE (this is the executable file that is loaded into the debugging environment). Next, Step through the code and check the values being set and control flow charts to check the state of your program. Attach to your program for execution on a line-by-line basis using the single-step execution feature so that you may ascertain how each command unfolds the program’s state. This way, the breakpoints help in making the execution slow, so one can see what is exactly going on in the program and make it easier to look for errors that are located near the breakpoints. It’s critical for learning Assembly language programming and knowledge acquisition.

**The PE Format and DLL Imports**

kernel32. dll has ExitProcess function and LoadLibrary function is in kernel32. DLL, which is located in the SysWOW64 folder to maintain the code compatibility with 32-bit operating systems. Some utilities in this functioning must be imported through the PE for use in the program, particularly within the . idata section.

The . he iLocalD wrction stts ith th Impt Ditctry Tble (IDT), in which xchnty is a RVs f RVs fr th ILT and IAT. ILT holds the pointers of the names of external functions that have to be imported by the DLL, while IAT holds pointers of these names and is filled at runtime with the actual addresses of the functions.

To create an . exe file, program, or application using FASM, you: In this case, copy the complete idata section and change it to KERNEL32. DLL and ExitProcess. This involves declaring the directory table and hint/name table as well as the IAT. It necessary to understand the 64­bit Windows calling convention which prescribes that the first four parameters must be passed through RCX, RDX, R8 and R9 registers and the stacked 32 bytes of shadow space to be used.

**Conclusion**

Finally, it is possible to state that, indeed, assembly language is a type of low-level programming language that would be versatile and efficient in controlling microprocessors and various programmable devices.  It is far from being employed in the daily job to develop an extensive application but it would be very inconvenient not to have it when the situation occurs to need to check into the CU generated from the CPU and possibly to steer the optimization process as well.  Well as specific valuable tools include Flat Assembler (FASM) as a tool for writing, assembling, and debugging x86-64 programs at one and the same time and WinDbg tool.  However, just for the record, even though you may not care about the features of the assembly language beyond the basic grammars, registers, memory, and addressing, examining simple instructions and the PE format with DLL imports would be more important if practiced at an examination.  One more thing is that the idea of the efficient programs are also depicted and at the same time a better understanding regarding how the computers work on an instruction at the lowest level is also achieved.
