1. Traffic analysis essential

Task 1 Introduction

The introduction shows the fundamental principles and objectives of Network Security, highlighting how Traffic Analysis helps find issues and anomalies within network data. Starting this learning journey, I knew that finishing the "Network Fundamentals" module first is important as it sets a strong base for understanding Traffic and Packet Analysis.

Task 2 Network Security and Network Data

In this task it goes deeper into the main ideas of Network Security like focusing on things such as making sure users are who they claims to be, providing them permission to access things, and making sure the network keeps working and stays dependable. The Base Network Security Control Levels show how rules for security are made, making sure to cover everything needed to keep the organization safe.

It also looks into Access Control and Threat Control which helps us understand different ways to handle how data moves and deal with the possible dangers. Also, Managed Security Services (MSS) come up as a helpful option for organizations that don't have enough resources. It also provides outside help to make security better and more efficient.

Task 3 Traffic Analysis

In this it shows the significance of Traffic Analysis in intercepting, monitoring, and analyzing network data to detect and respond to system health issues, anomalies, and threats. Going further, through the various techniques and benefits of Traffic Analysis, I appreciate its pivotal role in providing network visibility, facilitating asset tracking, and enabling proactive threat detections and response.

Engaging in this simulated traffic analysis operations offers a hands-on experience in identifying and filtering malicious IP addresses and ports, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical application. The challenges posed in identifying and mitigating potential threats underscore the importance of honing analytical skills and leveraging available tools and resources effectively.
