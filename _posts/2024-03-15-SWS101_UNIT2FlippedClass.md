Tier 0 offers many challenges like web exploitation, cryptography and reverse engineering. Each challenge gives us a puzzle to solve like finding it's vulnerabilities in a website, deciphering an encrypted messages and analyzing malware code. It's not just about breaking into systems; it's also about understanding how they work and how to defend against potential threats. Tier 0 is the foundation for our journey into the exciting and constantly evolving field of cybersecurity, honing our skills to become adept defenders of digital systems and guardians of online security.

From Hack The Box Tier 1, One of the important topics and key takeaways is the understanding of fundamental concepts in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Tier 1 introduces various security vulnerabilities and techniques commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. Participants learn about topics such as reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation. Tier 1 emphasizes the importance of proper documentation, methodology, and ethical considerations in ethical hacking practices. Participants learn to approach challenges systematically, utilizing tools and techniques to assess, exploit, and secure systems effectively. 

Tier 0 (Starting Point) covers fundamental concepts and basic techniques in cybersecurity. It is  known as an introductory level. In Tier 0, we learned:

1. Basic networking concepts: Understanding TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, subnetting, etc.
2. Introduction to Linux and Windows command line: Basic commands, file system navigation, etc.
3. Basic web application vulnerabilities: Understanding common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
4. Basic cryptography concepts: Symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing algorithms, etc.
5. Introduction to reconnaissance and enumeration techniques: Using tools like Nmap, enumeration of services, etc.

Tier 1 (Challenges) builds upon the foundational knowledge gained from Tier 0 and introduces more complex challenges and scenarios. We learned:

1. Advanced exploitation techniques: Exploiting specific vulnerabilities in various systems or applications.
2. Privilege escalation: Techniques to elevate privileges on compromised systems.
3. Post-exploitation: Activities conducted after gaining initial access to maintain access or gather more information.
4. Network pivoting: Expanding access within a network by leveraging compromised systems.
5. Reverse engineering: Analyzing and understanding the behavior of malware or binary executables.
