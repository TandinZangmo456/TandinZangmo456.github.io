What is NoSQL Database?
NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases which store data differently than relational tables. When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL”. 

Types of NoSQL Database
Document-based databases
It is a database which stores data in JSON, BSON or XML documents instead of storing in rows and columns. In this document based database, the particular element can be accessed by using the index value assigned for fast querying.

Key value based database
Key value databases are database in which data is stored in a “key-value” format and optimized for reading and writing that data. The documents in this database are Flexible schema, Faster creation and maintenance, No foreign keys and are of Open formats.

Graph Database
It is a database that is designed to handle data with complex relationships and interconnections. In a graph database, data is stored as nodes and edges in which nodes represent entities and edges represent the relationships between those entities. 

Vector Database
It is a database which indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval, similarity search, metadata filtering, horizontal scaling, and serverless. It is also a collection of data stored in mathematical representation.

Time Series Database
It is a database system designed to store and retrieve such data for each point in time. It is used in Financial trading systems,Recording stock prices over time and Asset-tracking applications.

Column oriented Databases
A columnar database is a database management system (DBMS)  which helps store the data in columns rather than rows. It is also responsible for speeding up the time required to return a particular query. When we run analytics on a small number of columns in the network, we can read those columns directly without consuming memory with unwanted data.
