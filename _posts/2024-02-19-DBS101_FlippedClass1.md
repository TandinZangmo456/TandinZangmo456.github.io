### Topic : Database users and Database Administrators
----
Key Concepts and Takeaways:
In our recent class about database management, we learnt about the types of database users and their importance and the roles and responsibilities of a Database Administrator (DBA). It was really interesting because we found out that there are 8 different types of users, like Database Administrators (DBAs), Naive / Parametric End Users, System Analyst, Sophisticated Users, Database Designers, Application Programmer, Casual Users / Temporary Users and specialized users who make special programs for it. Being a DBA involves more than just knowing how to use computers. They also have to make sure the database is safe from hackers, help people who use the database, and make sure everything runs smoothly and quickly. So, their responsibility is  not just about fixing computer problems but it's about making sure everyone who needs to use the database can do so safely and easily.

Questions and Areas for Further Exploration:
I think I understand databases very well now that I've done the course, but there are still some topics I would like to learn more about the information on optimizing database performance, prevent hacking and data dictionaries which seems to be really crucial for database management. These topics would help me improve my database management skills in many scenarios.

Application and Analysis of Concepts:
There are many roles and responsibilities that individuals take while learning and using database. Some users may lack familiarity with database and handle them carelessly while other users who possess a high level of skill or expertise in it may have a deep understanding of their capabilities. This shows the varying level of skills and experiences seen in various professions. By recognizing these different user groups, we can create databases that serve each and every users, regardless of their expertise. Database administrator also shows effective result in ensuring smooth operations in day to day life activities.

Assessment of Learning:
On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate my understanding of the material at a solid 4. While I understand the broad concepts and responsibilities of a DBA and database users, there are differences within certain areas, such as data optimization and practical applications, that I still need to explore further.

Feedback on Flipped Classroom Format:
Overall, I find the flipped classroom format to be effective in providing pre-class materials that lay the groundwork for in-depth discussions during class sessions.
