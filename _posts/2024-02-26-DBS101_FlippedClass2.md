### Topic : Entity Relationship Diagram
----

Key Concepts and Takeaways:
An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation of the entities, attributes and relationships present in a database.

Entities represent real-world objects or concepts, such as a person, place, thing, or event. It uses rectangle shape.
Attributes describe the characteristics of entities. It uses oval shape.
Relationships describe how entities are related to each other and the attributes.

Primary Key is a unique identifier for each tuple in a relation.
Foreign Key connects to the primary key of another relation. 
A Superkey is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
Candidate Key is a minimal superkey without redundant attributes.

What I learned in fliiped class:
In the flipped class on the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the topic on bus booking system in Bhutan, I learned about how the  different parts of a system interact and relate to each other. Since We had a good understanding of entities, relationships, attributes, and keys. We used these concepts to draw our ERD. We used different shapes for entities, relationships and attributes which helped us visualize how all the parts of our the ERD are connected.

Firstly, we identified the entities, attributes and relationships between each. For our bus booking system, we had entities like Users, Buses, Customers, Bookings.We also learned about the relationships between the entities. For example, a User can make many Bookings, but each Booking is linked to one User which is known as one-to-many relationship. Each entities have their own specific attributes like, a User has a user_ID,name, email, and password. Not only this but We also encountered keys, which are a special attributes that uniquely identify each record in an entity like the UserID, BusID, and CustomerID because they help us find and manage data about specific users, buses and Customers.

We talked about how to use it to plan our system, how to update it when things change, and how it can help us avoid mistakes in our system design. The ERD is like a roadmap for our system, guiding us through the process of building it.

In conclusion, learning about ERDs in flipped classroom session was a valuable learning experience. It not only deepened my understanding of ERD, but it also taught me how to apply that knowledge to real-world problems. Creating our own ERDs in a hands-on way made learning more interesting and meaningful. I am excited to apply these skills to future projects and further explore the world of database design and software development.
